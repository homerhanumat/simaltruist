<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#writing-and-using-custom-functions" class="anchor"></a>Writing and Using Custom Functions</h2>
<p>The <code><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate()</a></code> function provides for a certain amount of customization of two important phases in the simulation of a single generation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way in which mating couples are formed;</li>
<li>how warners behave when the population is under attack by a predator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these behaviors may be controlled and programmed by the user, by means of the parameters <code>mating_behavior</code> and <code>attack_behavior</code>.</p>
<div id="mating-behavior" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#mating-behavior" class="anchor"></a>Mating Behavior</h3>
<p>By default, the behavior of a mating couple is determined by the function <code><a href="reference/randomMatches.html">randomMatches()</a></code>, the source code of which is given below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">randomMatches &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="cf">function</span>(individuals, number_of_couples) {
  females &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(individuals, sex <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "F"</span>)
  breedingFemales &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>females[<span class="kw">sample</span>(
    <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="kw">nrow</span>(females),
    <span class="dt">size =</span> number_of_couples,
    <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>), ]
  males &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">subset</span>(individuals,sex <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> "M"</span>)
  chosenMales &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>males[<span class="kw">sample</span>(
    <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="kw">nrow</span>(males),
    <span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="kw">nrow</span>(breedingFemales),
    <span class="dt">replace =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>), ]
  <span class="kw">list</span>(<span class="dt">females =</span> breedingFemales, <span class="dt">males =</span> chosenMales)
}</code></pre></div>
<p>As the code shows, the default behavior is for fertile females to select randomly from the set of males.</p>
<p>As for the arguments, <code>individuals</code> is a data frame that is computed at the beginning of each generation. Each row represents a living member of the population. The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>id</code>: a string giving the ID-number of the individual;</li>
<li>
<code>sex</code>: the sex of the individual;</li>
<li>
<code>warner</code>: a numerical variable with values 0, 1, or 2, giving the number of altruistic alleles the individual possesses.</li>
<li>
<code>mom</code>: a string giving the ID-number of the individual’s mother;</li>
<li>
<code>dad</code>: a string giving the ID-number of the individual’s mother.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to write one’s own mating function and pass it to <code><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate()</a></code> via the <code>mating_behavior</code> parameter. An example of such a custom function is exported by <strong>simaltruist</strong> as <code><a href="reference/sexualSelection.html">sexualSelection()</a></code>, the source code for which maybe be viewed <a href="https://github.com/homerhanumat/simaltruist/blob/master/R/reproduce.R">here</a>.</p>
<p>The formal parameters of the function are shown in the definition below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">sexualSelection &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="cf">function</span>(
  individuals,
  number_of_couples,

  ) {
  ## function body
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Examples of its use are provided in the package documentation, e.g.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pop &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate</a></span>(<span class="dt">sim_gens =</span> <span class="dv">200</span>,

                      <span class="dt">nrow =</span> <span class="dv">3</span>,
                      <span class="dt">ncol =</span> <span class="dv">3</span>))))</code></pre></div>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" alt="Sexual selection:  opposites attract!" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Sexual selection: opposites attract!
</p>
</div>
<p>In the above example, the preference matrix is:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th align="left">male0</th>
<th align="left">male1</th>
<th align="left">male2</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>female0</em></td>
<td align="left">1</td>
<td align="left">5</td>
<td align="left">10</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><em>female1</em></td>
<td align="left">1</td>
<td align="left">1</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>female02</em></td>
<td align="left">10</td>
<td align="left">5</td>
<td align="left">1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We see that 0-allele females prefer 1-allele and 2-allele males. In fact when presented with three males, one of each genotype, she is five times as likely to prefer the 1-allele male over the 0-allele male, and ten times as likely to prefer the 2-allele male over the 0-allele male. Zero-allele females have a reverse preference, and single-allele females are indifferent in their choice.</p>
<p>Note that <code>args</code> specifies only the value of the <code>prefs</code> parameter of <code>sexualSelection</code>. The other two parameters of this function—<code>individuals</code> and <code>number_of_couples</code> are computed by <code><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate()</a></code> and provided to <code><a href="reference/sexualSelection.html">sexualSelection()</a></code> when it is called.</p>
<p>For custom mating functions the possible provided parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>individuals</code>, the data frame described above;</li>
<li><code>number_of_couples</code></li>
<li>
<code>relMatrix</code>, a matrix (described below) of relationship-degree between living individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a custom mating function must return a named list containing two elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>females</code>: a character vector consisting of the id numbers of female mates;</li>
<li>
<code>males</code>: a character vector consisting of the id numbers of male mates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corresponding elements of the two vectors represent a single couple.</p>
</div>
<div id="attack-behavior" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#attack-behavior" class="anchor"></a>Attack Behavior</h3>
<p>By default the behavior of a warner when the population is under attack is governed by the function <code><a href="reference/warnRelatives.html">warnRelatives()</a></code>, described in the package documentation. Again it is possible for the user to pass in a modified version of this function or an entirely new function, via the parameter <code>attack_behavior</code>.</p>
<p>An example of an alternative attack-behavior function is the exported function <a href="https://github.com/homerhanumat/simaltruist/blob/master/R/attack.R"><code><a href="reference/warnWarners.html">warnWarners()</a></code></a>, in which each warner warns only other warners, without regard to their relationship to him or her:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pop &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw"><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate</a></span>(<span class="dt">sim_gens =</span> <span class="dv">100</span>,
                <span class="dt">attack_behavior =</span> <span class="kw">list</span>(
                  <span class="dt">fn =</span> warnWarners,
                  <span class="dt">args =</span> <span class="kw">list</span>(
                    <span class="dt">number_warned =</span> <span class="dv">7</span>,
                    <span class="dt">dominant =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)))</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/fig-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Again it is only necessary to set the values of parameters that are not automatically provided by the <code><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate()</a></code> function. Provided values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>individuals</code>, described previously;</li>
<li>three parameters provided to <code><a href="reference/simulate.html">simulate()</a></code>:
<ul>
<li><code>warner_death_prob</code></li>
<li><code>nonwarner_death_prob</code></li>
<li><code>hider_death_prob</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>relMatrix</code>, a matrix with row and columns names corresponding to the ID-numbers of all living individuals. The cells give the degree of relationship between any given pair of individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a custom attack function must return a numerical vector of death probabilities, with the <span class="math inline">\(i^{\text{th}}\)</span> element corresponding to row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of <code>individuals</code>.</p>
